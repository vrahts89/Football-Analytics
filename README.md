## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Welcome to the repository for our cutting-edge football analytics project! This endeavor was inspired by a deep-seated passion for the beautiful game and an unquenchable curiosity about the intricate dynamics that define it. In a world where data is king, we recognized an untapped potential in harnessing advanced analytics to unravel the mysteries of football. Our goal is to delve beyond traditional statistics:

Question 1) Can we measure the impact on individual players on a teams success rate and use it as a metric for scouting promising players
Question 2) Is there an impact on a teams age distribution on the success rate
Question/Task 3) What are the most relevant attributes on a player's market valuation and can we derive a prediction model for the market value.

Through rigorous data analysis and innovative approaches, we aim to uncover insights that could revolutionize our understanding of player performance and team strategy. Whether you're a data enthusiast, a football fan, or both, we invite you to join us on this exciting journey as we decode the secrets of the game.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

In the Data Files folder you will find the relevant csv files that were used for this analysis. However due to files size limitations I had to shorten some of the files (namely: appearances.csv, game_events.csv, player_valuations.csv. Therefore if you perform the same analysis with the provided data sets you will receive different results. For current data you can visit the github repo of dcaribou mentioned below. The large files can be downloaded here: https://file.io/sGOev9xLSRi7
